# MakerHealth Community Guidelines
We believes that everyone can create health technology. To support the global network of health makers we built MakerHealth Create as a platform to share the DIY health technology projects with the community. We expect that all makers uploading projects will follow these guidelines to help foster a collaborative community of health makers.

## POSTING PROJECTS

### HEALTH RELATED
Projects uploaded to MakerHealth Create must have a reasonable health application. 

### OWNERSHIP
Only post projects you have created or have permission from the creator to post. 

### SHARE TO TEACH
Include enough details in your posting to enable others to recreate the project.

### EXTERNAL LINKS
Include links for digital files, code, and supporting documents for the project background (i.e.: github, hackster.io, thingiverse, pubmed). Projects that only include links to external sites with documentation will be set to private until further fabrication and experimentation details are included.

## PROJECT REVIEW

### REVIEW
Projects are not validated by the MakerHealth team. Only post projeccts that you believe impact health. 

### MAKERHEALTH COMMUNITY
The MakerHealth team reviews the projects for fit to the community, but not clinical efficacy.
